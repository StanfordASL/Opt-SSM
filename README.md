## Installation

It is recommended to work in a virtual environment.
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Opt-SSM:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Example usage of the OptSSM class:

```python
from utils.ssm import OptSSM

opt_ssm = OptSSM(aut_trajs_obs=aut_trajs_obs,
                 t_split=3.5,
                 SSMDim=5,
                 SSMOrder=2,
                 ROMOrder=2,
                 N_delay=3,
                 ts=ts,
                 verbose=True)
```
