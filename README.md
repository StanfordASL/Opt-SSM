# Opt-SSM ü§ñüöÄ
*A toolbox for learning optimal projections onto spectral submanifolds*

This codebase accompanies the paper **_Taming High-Dimensional Dynamics: Learning Optimal Projections onto Spectral Submanifolds_** ([arXiv:2504.03157](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03157))

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

It is recommended to work in a virtual environment.

First clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:StanfordASL/Opt-SSM.git
cd Opt-SSM
```
Install the required package dependencies and the package itself in editable mode using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```
Note that SSMLearnPy is currently only compatible with NumPy 1.24.3, so if you have a different version of NumPy installed, you may need to downgrade it.
Additionally, we make use of IPOPT, which has to be installed.
In case you are using conda, this can be installed using:
```bash
conda install conda-forge::ipopt
```
Finally, we recommend using Gurobi for the solving the MPC, which has to be installed separately.
However, one can also use OSQP, which can be set in the `run_mpc` function in the [mpc](./opt_ssm/mpc.py) file.

## üìò Usage
Example usage of the OptSSM class:

```python
from utils.ssm import OptSSM

opt_ssm = OptSSM(aut_trajs_obs=aut_trajs_obs,
                 t_split=3.5,
                 SSMDim=5,
                 SSMOrder=2,
                 ROMOrder=2,
                 N_delay=3,
                 ts=ts)
```
